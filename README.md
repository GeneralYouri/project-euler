# Project Euler
Project Euler Solutions (JS) - https://projecteuler.net/

---

Requires NodeJS v10.4.0 or higher

Run via
```bash
node .
```
By default this will attempt to run every problem solution, in order.

Run via `node . --help` for information about accepted arguments and flags, such as which problem to run and what its input is.

Alternatively you can also run every problem solution individually by executing the problem folder's `index.js` file.
This approach also lets you customize the problem input in a similar way, through additional command line arguments.

Per problem you'll find the following contents:
- A problem README providing context on the problem as well as details and explanations about the used solution(s).
- An `input.txt` file containing the default input to work with, as obtained via the official Project Euler website.
- A main solution file containing the code to solve the problem in an abstract way, generally accepting any input values.
- Zero or more alternative solution files that approach and solve the problem in a different but still interesting way.
- A test file for each (alternative) solution file that tests the code against various inputs/outputs.
  These contain sample inputs/outputs from the official website, the official input also from the official website, and other input/output combinations of interest.
