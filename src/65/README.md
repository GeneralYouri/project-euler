# [Problem 65](https://projecteuler.net/problem=65): Convergents of e

For the example of the square root of 2 it's fairly easy to see how the numerator and denominator are derived every step.
The numerator increases by 2 times the denominator, while the denominator increases by 1 time the numerator.

For `e` the formula is a bit more difficult, but since we're only interested in the numerator we can greatly simplify it.
To do this we take the above formulas for handling the square root of 2, with the multiplier of 2 replaced by the corresponding partial value.
