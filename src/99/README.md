# [Problem 99](https://projecteuler.net/problem=99): Largest exponential

For this problem we're not very interested in the actual values of the numbers, only in their value relative to the other numbers.
In such a case it's very easy to keep the large numbers small, by working with log10 values instead of the actual numbers.
Instead of taking the base to the exponent as you would normally, now we multiply the log10 of the base by the exponent.
