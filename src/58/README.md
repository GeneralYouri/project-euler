# [Problem 58](https://projecteuler.net/problem=58): Spiral primes

We can easily generate the numbers on the diagonals of the square spiral.
Starting with 1, the first layer (from size 1 to size 3) adds the numbers 3, 5, 7, 9; a delta of +2 for every next number.
For the next layer (from size 3 to size 5) we add 13, 17, 21, 25; a delta of +4 for every next number.
This delta continues to grow linearly as the square spiral size grows.
