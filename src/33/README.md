# [Problem 33](https://projecteuler.net/problem=33): Digit cancelling fractions

I personally found this problem description a little vague, but it turns out that it's actually really simple.
All you need to do is create fractions with 2 digits for both numerator and denominator, with the last digit of the numerator equaling the first digit of the denominator.
The logic involved speaks for itself and is very simple.

Due to the vague description I'm not sure how to generalize this solution for n digits.
This means that unfortunately the given solution here is specifically for the problem input only.
