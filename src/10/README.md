# [Problem 10](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10): Summation of primes

Similar to [Problem 7](https://github.com/GeneralYouri/project-euler/blob/master/src/7/README.md), we can use a prime generator to generate and sum all primes up to our input limit.
For this particular problem, the [Sieve of Erathosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) fits particularly well.
This is implemented in my toolkit, so using it for the solution here is trivial.
