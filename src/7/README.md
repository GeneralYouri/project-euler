# [Problem 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7): 10001st prime

Nothing new here.
We use the `primeGenerator` as first used in [Problem 3](https://github.com/GeneralYouri/project-euler/blob/master/src/3/solution.js#L13).
We iterate it 10001 times, and return the generated prime.
With just this fairly straightforward generator, we could go a whole lot further than just the 10001st prime.
